== TERMINOLOGY ==
- "player" — the single human-controlled character. The player is the only one who performs quest actions.
- "character" — any named person in the world (player or NPC). Used when referring to people in general.
- "NPC" — a non-player character (e.g. sarah, marcus, george, anne, mary, linda, viktor, the_doctor).
  NPCs appear in dialogue and the world state but do NOT perform quest steps — only the player does.
- "actor" — the field in each step that names who performs that action. For all quest steps, actor = "player".

== QUEST DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS ==
1. Read the situation — it describes a problem or state of the world, not a solution. You decide how to resolve it.
2. Be creative. The player might find a cure, or might decide to burn everything down. Both are valid.
3. Use only characters, locations, and items that exist in the world state. Character names must be used exactly as they appear — do not rename, invent, or substitute any character.
4. Only use actions from the provided action library. All actions are performed by the player.
5. CRITICAL — DIALOGUE: Every TALK action MUST include a "dialogue_content" field in its parameters.
   - It MUST be an array of turn objects, each with exactly: "speaker" (character name or "PLAYER") and "line".
   - Minimum 2 turns, maximum 8 turns.
   - Dialogue must match the actions that follow — a character must not promise to do something the player executes.
   - OMIT "dialogue_content" entirely for all non-TALK actions.
6. CRITICAL — MOVEMENT: Before every PICKUP or interaction, verify the player is at the correct location. If not, add a MOVE step first.
6b. CRITICAL — GIVE_ITEM: The player is always the actor (giver). The NPC is always the target (receiver). If an NPC is handing something to the player, model this as the player picking it up with PICKUP — not GIVE_ITEM.
7. CRITICAL — LOCKED PLACES: A location with the "locked" condition CANNOT be entered with MOVE. The player MUST use UNLOCK with the correct key item first. Check every location's conditions in the world state before planning any MOVE or action inside it. Ignoring a locked condition is invalid output.
   Also: if a location does NOT have "locked" in its conditions, it is already open — do NOT plan an UNLOCK for it.
8. Follow all world rules strictly.
9. Number steps globally (1, 2, 3...) across all quests in the chapter.
10. CRITICAL — QUEST START: Every quest MUST begin with a MOVE step followed immediately by a TALK with an NPC at that location. NO quest may start with TALK, PICKUP, or any other action before the first MOVE. No exceptions.
10b. CRITICAL — NO DUPLICATE TALKS: Never plan two consecutive TALK actions with the same NPC at the same location. Merge them into a single TALK with a longer dialogue_content array (up to 8 turns).
11. CRITICAL — WORLD STATE GROUNDING: Before planning any step, verify it against the world state.
   (a) ITEMS: every item you reference must be at the exact location listed in the world state items list — do not assume an item is somewhere based on its name or theme.
   (b) PATHS: to reach a location connected through locked intermediaries, you must UNLOCK and MOVE through every hop in the chain — you cannot jump directly to a deep location.
   (c) If your plan requires an item or location that the world state does not support, choose a different approach.

- All quest steps are performed by the player. NPCs appear only in dialogue and world state.
- IMPORTANT: Only use the NPC names listed in NPC LOCATIONS above. Never invent new character names.
- IMPORTANT: Every quest must start with the player MOVEing to a location where an NPC is present, followed immediately by a TALK with that NPC. No quest may begin with any other action.
- IMPORTANT: Never plan two consecutive TALK actions with the same NPC at the same location — merge them into one TALK.
- IMPORTANT: Check EVERY location's conditions before planning any MOVE or UNLOCK. If a location has "locked" in its conditions, use UNLOCK first. If it does NOT have "locked", do not plan UNLOCK — it is already open.
- IMPORTANT: If an NPC gives something to the player, model this as PICKUP by the player — not GIVE_ITEM. GIVE_ITEM is only for the player giving items to NPCs.
- IMPORTANT: NPC characters with the "infected" condition can only speak in dialogue. They cannot perform actions.
- For every TALK action, write the actual dialogue as a dialogue_content array of speaker/line turn objects.
- Follow all world rules.
- Number steps globally across all quests.
